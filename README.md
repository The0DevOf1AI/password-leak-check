# Password Leak Checker (File-Based)

This Python script checks whether a list of passwords (stored in a file) have been exposed in known data breaches by querying the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords) Pwned Passwords API.

It uses SHA-1 hashing and the k-Anonymity technique to ensure that your full password is never sent to the API, protecting your privacy.

---

## üîß Features

- Reads passwords from a `.txt` file (comma-separated).
- Checks each password against the Pwned Passwords API.
- Reports how many times each password has been found in data breaches.
- Secure: never transmits the full password or hash.

## üß∞ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

You can install the required dependency with:
