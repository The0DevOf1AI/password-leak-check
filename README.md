# Password Leak Checker (File-Based)

This Python script checks whether a list of passwords (stored in a file) have been exposed in known data breaches by querying the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords) Pwned Passwords API.

It uses SHA-1 hashing and the k-Anonymity technique to ensure that your full password is never sent to the API, protecting your privacy.
